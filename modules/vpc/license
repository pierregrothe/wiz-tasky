### Explanation

- **Optimized `tags.tf`:**  
  We renamed the local variable to `merged_tags` to clearly convey its purpose. The tag keys are now in lowercase and hyphenated, following the best practices. The use of `lookup` ensures that if a cost-center tag isn’t provided in `var.tags_env`, we default to `"wiz-tasky"`.

- **`versions.tf`:**  
  This file pins our AWS provider version and specifies a minimum Terraform version, ensuring consistency across deployments.

- **`README.md`:**  
  A brief yet comprehensive guide to the VPC module helps maintain clarity for future developers or audits.

Let me know if this meets your expectations or if there’s anything else you’d like to refine, Pierre!
